== Soundclails

The intent of the project was to play around with Soundcloud and Youtube APIs.

The final result is an analyzer of the provided Soundcloud playlist, that supports filters like: downloadable, less/most liked, less/most viewed. 
                   
Youtube API was used to show top 10 results on Youtube for a specific song title.

Live example and instructions on how to use it, can be found {here}[https://soundclails.herokuapp.com/].
